Qelsius is a simple weather app written in PyQt5.

NOTE: This is a personal project, created for personal use. If you intend to test this project you must use your own OpenWeatherAPI valid key
(5 days 3-hours forecast).

Dependencies: python, pyqt5

Qelsius expects a valid location to be entered (a city or a country/region). After that, a 4 day forecast will be displayed (temperatures in Celsius degrees), as well as icons indicating sunny weather, clouds, rain or snow. Qelsius will always display the weather for the last valid location you entered.

If you want to test this, replace the "api_key" field in the config.json file with your own personal OpenWeather API key.
